# Abstract
An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car can go and does everything that an experienced human driver does. But itâ€™s very essential to train it properly.  One of the many steps involved during the training of an autonomous driving car is lane detection  This project aims to identify lane lines on the road with the help of OpenCV using python.
Here I plan to identify lane lines from a pre-recorded video. OpenCV method uses the input images to find any lane lines command and render out an illustration of the lane. The OpenCV tools like color selection, the region of interest selection, grey scaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection, and Hough Transform line detection are the key concepts for this project.
